# AWS Deployment Project: Power Calculation Web Application

## Overview
This project demonstrates a web application hosted on AWS Amplify that calculates the power of two numbers. This project, while simple in concept, serves as a practical exercise in leveraging key AWS services like Amplify, API Gateway, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB, providing valuable insights into their integration and functionality. 

## Architecture
The architecture involves the following components:
- **AWS Amplify**: Hosts the frontend web application.
- **API Gateway**: Receives HTTP requests from the frontend and triggers Lambda functions.
- **Lambda Function**: Computes the power of two numbers passed via API Gateway.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores the computed results.
